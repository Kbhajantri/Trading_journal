- Journals organized by user email
- Search functionality to find journals by email
- Ability to view and manage all user journals

### 4. Updated Components
- Dashboard now shows user email
- Journal entries display owner information

## Database Changes

### New Migration: `002_add_email_views.sql`

#### Views Created:
- `trading_journals_with_email`: Combines trading journals with user email information

#### Functions Created:
- `get_trading_journals_by_email(user_email TEXT)`: Get journals for a specific email
- `get_all_trading_journals_with_email()`: Get all journals with email info (admin function)

#### Indexes Added:
- `idx_users_email`: Index on users.email for better query performance

## API Endpoints

### Database Service Methods

#### New Methods:
```typescript
// Get journals with email information for a user
getTradingJournalsWithEmail(userId: string)

// Get journals by email address
getTradingJournalsByEmail(email: string)

// Get specific journal with email information
getTradingJournalWithEmail(journalId: string)

// Get all journals with email information (admin)
getAllTradingJournalsWithEmail()

// Alternative methods using database views
getTradingJournalsByEmailView(email: string)
getAllTradingJournalsWithEmailView()
```

## New Pages

### Admin Journals Page (`/admin/journals`)
- Displays all trading journals organized by user email
- Search functionality to filter by email
- Ability to open and delete journals
- Shows total journal count per user

## Component Updates

### DashboardSection
- Added "View All Journals" link to admin page
- Displays user email in header
- Shows owner email for each journal entry

### TradingJournalSection
- Displays journal owner email
- Updated to use new interface with email information

### AllJournalsSection (New Component)
- Groups journals by user email
- Search functionality
- Displays user information and journal counts

## Type Definitions

### New Interface:
```typescript
interface TradingJournalWithEmail extends TradingJournal {
  user_email: string;
  user_name: string;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Getting Journals by Email
```typescript
// Get all journals for a specific email
const { data, error } = await databaseService.getTradingJournalsByEmail('user@example.com');

// Get all journals (admin function)
const { data, error } = await databaseService.getAllTradingJournalsWithEmail();
```

### Using the Admin Interface
1. Navigate to `/admin/journals`
2. View all journals organized by email
3. Use the search box to filter by email address
4. Click on any journal to open it
5. Use delete buttons to remove journals

## Security Considerations

- All database functions use Row Level Security (RLS)
- Users can only access their own journals
- Admin functions require proper authentication
- Email information is protected by existing RLS policies

## Performance Optimizations

- Database views for efficient queries
- Indexes on email fields
- Optimized database functions
- Cached queries where appropriate

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Notifications**: Send email alerts for journal updates
2. **Email Export**: Export journal data to email
3. **Email Sharing**: Share journals via email
4. **Bulk Operations**: Perform operations on multiple journals by email
5. **Email Analytics**: Track journal activity by email domain

## Migration Notes

To apply these changes:

1. Run the new migration: `002_add_email_views.sql`
2. Update your application code to use the new interfaces
3. Test the admin interface at `/admin/journals`
4. Verify that existing journals display email information correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Email not displaying**: Ensure the user has a valid email in the users table
2. **Admin page not accessible**: Check authentication and RLS policies
3. **Slow queries**: Verify that indexes are created properly
4. **Missing email data**: Check if the user creation trigger is working correctly

### Debug Commands:

```sql
-- Check if email view exists
SELECT * FROM trading_journals_with_email LIMIT 5;

-- Test email function
SELECT * FROM get_trading_journals_by_email('user@example.com');

-- Check user emails
SELECT id, email, name FROM users;
```
